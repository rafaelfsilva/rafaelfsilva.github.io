<p>The workshop took place on Wednesday, 11 November 2020 and the program featured 
an invited keynote by Prof. <a href="https://globalcomputing.group/about.html">Michela Taufer</a> 
(UTK), entitled “<em>In Situ Data Analytics for Next Generation Molecular Dynamics Workflows</em>”. 
The program also featured talks from 8 research papers (accepted after a rigorous review 
process where each paper received at least three reviews). The proceedings include the 
eight full papers accepted and presented at the workshop.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the authors, the presenters, the general chair, the steering 
committee, the program committee, and the SC20 workshop chairs – without their 
excellent work and contributions WORKS would not be successful.</p>
