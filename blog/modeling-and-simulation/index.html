<p>This presentation provides an overview of three <strong>open source tools</strong>
that have supported research and development of cyberinfrastructure
tools via modeling and simulation:</p>

</a></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://simgrid.org">SimGrid</a></strong> provides foundational simulation 
models and abstractions for simulating distributed applications, systems, and 
platforms. It has been stable for many years, has a large user community, and 
has a regular release cycle. It has been used successfully in many distributed 
computing domains and has provided simulation results for 400+ research publications.</p>

</a></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://wrench-project.org">WRENCH</a></strong> builds on SimGrid, so that simulations 
can be accurate and scalable, but provides high-level simulation abstractions. 
For instance, it provides several simulated implementations of “compute services” 
for bare-metal hardware resources, virtualized hardware resources, cloud platforms,
batch-scheduled clusters, or HTCondor pools.  As a result, implementing
simulators of complex scenarios can be done with minimal software engineering
efforts.</p>

</a></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://wfcommons.org">WfCommons</a></strong> is a framework for enabling 
scientific workflow research and development by providing foundational tools 
for analyzing workflow execution instances, generating workflow recipes, and 
generating synthetic, yet realistic, workflow instances that can be used to 
develop new techniques, algorithms and systems that can overcome the challenges 
of efficient and robust execution of ever larger workflows on increasingly complex 
distributed infrastructures.</p>
