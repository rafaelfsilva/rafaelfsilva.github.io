<p>WRENCH enables novel avenues for scientific workflow use, research, development, and education. WRENCH capitalizes on recent and critical advances in the state of the art of distributed platform/application simulation. WRENCH builds on top of the open-source SimGrid simulation framework. SimGrid enables the simulation of large-scale distributed applications in a way that is accurate (via validated simulation models), scalable (low ratio of simulation time to simulated time, ability to run large simulations on a single computer with low compute, memory, and energy footprints), and expressive (ability to simulate arbitrary platform, application, and execution scenarios). WRENCH provides directly usable high-level simulation abstractions using SimGrid as a foundation. More information on <a href="https://wrench-project.org">https://wrench-project.org</a>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, WRENCH makes it possible to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prototype implementations of Workflow Management System (WMS) components and underlying algorithms;</li>
  <li>Quickly, scalably, and accurately simulate arbitrary workflow and platform scenarios for a simulated WMS implementation; and</li>
  <li>Run extensive experimental campaigns to conclusively compare workflow executions, platform architectures, and WMS algorithms and designs.</li>
</ul>
