<p><strong>Abstract –</strong> In the field of HPC research and development, simulation has mainly been used for the purpose of evaluating and comparing the performance of application implementations and of the algorithms therein. While this use remains critical, for good reasons, many other compelling use cases have emerged. These have often been made possible by recent advances in the simulation methodologies at the core of available simulation frameworks. Examples of new areas in which simulation has become a compelling proposition include debugging and verification, application/simulation co-design, and HPC education. In this multi-part mini-symposium, we bring together researchers who have contributed to traditional and explored emerging uses of simulation of HPC systems and applications. The objective is for them to share their experiences, present recent results, identify areas of convergence, and discuss future directions.</p>
