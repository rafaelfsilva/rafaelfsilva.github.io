<p>On January 13, 2021, the <a href="http://workflowsri.org"><strong>workflowsRI</strong></a> and 
<a href="http://exaworks.org">ExaWorks</a> projects organized the <a href="https://workflowsri.org/summits/community/"><strong>Workflows Community 
Summit</strong></a>. This unique event 
gathered a select group of lead researchers from distinct workflow management 
systems, and sought to identify crucial challenges in the workflow community.</p>

<p>This event was the first of a series of focused meetings, and has served to 
define the strategic goals for upcoming meetings with the science and workflow 
developer communities.</p>

<p>The summit program consisted of two overview talks about each project 
organizing the event, and six breakout sessions targeting pressing 
needs from the workflows community, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Theme 1: FAIR computational workflows (Carole Goble)</li>
  <li>Theme 2: Training and education for workflow users (Lavanya Ramakrishnan)</li>
  <li>Theme 3: AI workflows (Luc Peterson)</li>
  <li>Theme 4: Exascale challenges and beyond (Bjoern Enders)</li>
  <li>Theme 5: APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards (Douglas Thain)</li>
  <li>Theme 6: Building a workflows community (Ilkay Altintas)</li>
</ul>
