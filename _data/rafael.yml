    - title: Leadership & Strategic Programs
      paragraphs:
        - |
          In this section head role, I provide strategic and operational leadership for the organization, which includes 45+ researchers across five groups specializing in AI/ML, visualization, data workflows, engineering, and performance systems. I also lead program development and proposal efforts, securing <a href="/funding">$65M+ in funded awards</a> across 21 competitively reviewed proposals, advancing work in autonomous laboratories, scientific workflow systems, cyberinfrastructure, and AI-driven data analytics.
        - |
          I am a co-PI for the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-advances-investments-ai-science" target="_blank">Transformational AI model consortium</a> (ModCon), a cornerstone of the U.S. DOE <a href="https://genesis.energy.gov/" target="_blank">Genesis Mission</a>'s AI models and data efforts that will build and deploy self-improving AI models to advance science, engineering, and energy missions. I am also the PI of a DOE-funded project on robotics, automated laboratories, and autonomous control of large-scale experiments in support of Genesis, leveraging embodied AI, advanced automation, and robotics to transform laboratory environments and experimental workflows.

    - title: Systems Research & Community
      paragraphs:
        - |
          My research sits at the intersection of advanced distributed systems and scientific innovation, spanning scientific workflows, agentic workflows and provenance capture, autonomous science, and hybrid quantum-classical systems. I provide strategic direction and leadership for scheduling, modeling, and optimization methods that scale across cloud, edge, and HPC environments, accelerating discovery and ensuring robust, trustworthy computational pipelines.
        - |
          Additionally, as the Founder and Executive Director of the <a href="http://workflows.community" target="_blank">Workflows Community Initiative</a>, I foster collaboration and advancement in workflows research and development, connecting researchers and practitioners to share knowledge and drive innovation. I am also a co-Founder of the <a href="https://autonomousscience.org/" target="_blank">Autonomous Science Network</a>. Previously, I led the <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/about-olcf/staff-sections/advanced-technologies/workflows-ecosystem-services/" target="_blank">Workflow and Ecosystem Services</a> (WES) group within the <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/division/nccs" target="_blank">National Center for Computational Sciences</a> (NCCS). I am a Senior Member of IEEE and ACM.
